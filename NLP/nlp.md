# What is NLP?
- `Natural Language Processing` is a branch of `Artifical Intelligence` that focus on enabling computers to `understand, interpret, and generate human language`(text to speech).

**It sits at the intersection of** : 
    - `Linguistics` (rules and structure of language).
    - `Computer Science`(algorithms, Programming).
    - `Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning`(Teaching system to learn patterns).

**Example Tasks in NLP** : 

- Translating a sentence from English to Hindi(Machine Translation).
- Identifying whether a review is positive or negative(Sentiment Analysis).
- Extracting names of people/places from new articles(Named entity Recognition).
- Talking to a chatbot(Conversational AI).

**Why it's Important** : 

- Human Language is `ambiguous, complex, and context-dependent`.
- NLP helps bridge the gap between human communication and machine understanding.
